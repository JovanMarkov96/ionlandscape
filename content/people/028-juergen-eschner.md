Jürgen Eschner leads the **Quantum Photonics Group** at Saarland University, where the research program is dedicated to the controlled interaction between light and matter in the quantum mechanical regime. The main objective of his group’s work is to study and experimentally realize the transformation between **quantum states of individual photons and individual atoms/ions**, employing high-finesse optical resonators, single trapped particles, and entangled photon pairs.

The group’s publication record shows a strong focus on **quantum networking tools**, often implemented using **single trapped ⁴⁰Ca⁺ ions** as quantum memories or interfaces, and on **neutral atom systems (ytterbium)** in cavity quantum electrodynamics and related dynamics.

## Research Highlights

* **Trapped-ion quantum networking & interfaces:**  
  - Demonstration of quantum network protocols over 14 km urban fiber links and implementation of a **quantum repeater node with free-space coupled trapped ions**.  
  - Telecom quantum photonic interfaces for a **40Ca⁺ single-ion quantum memory**.  
  - High-fidelity entanglement between a trapped ion and a telecom photon via quantum frequency conversion.

* **Atom-photon entanglement and Bell measurements:**  
  - Full Bell-basis measurement of an atom-photon 2-qubit state and its application for quantum networks.

* **Neutral atom cavity QED & cold atoms:**  
  - Studies on the dynamics of **cold Yb atoms** in high-finesse cavities, including optical bistability and lasing behavior.

* **Foundational atom-ion interaction studies:**  
  - Early work on programmable atom-photon quantum interfaces employing single trapped **⁴⁰Ca⁺**.  
  - Investigations of single-photon absorption by single ions and quantum interference in ion emission/absorption processes.
