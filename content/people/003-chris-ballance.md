Dr. Chris Ballance is a physicist and quantum-technology leader working on trapped-ion quantum computing across academia and industry. He completed his DPhil (PhD) at the University of Oxford under Prof. David M. Lucas, with a thesis on high-fidelity trapped-ion quantum logic.

He co-founded Oxford Ionics, a spin-out developing trapped-ion quantum processors, and later joined IonQ, where he serves as President of Quantum Computing. His work spans ion-qubit control, high-fidelity quantum gates, and scalable trapped-ion architectures.
