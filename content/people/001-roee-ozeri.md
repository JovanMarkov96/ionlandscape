Prof. Roee Ozeri is an experimental physicist working in atomic physics and quantum information science. He earned a BSc in Physics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and completed his MSc and PhD in Physics at the Weizmann Institute of Science under Prof. Nir Davidson.

After his PhD, he conducted postdoctoral research at NIST in Boulder in the group of David J. Wineland, and subsequently joined the faculty of the Weizmann Institute of Science, where he established a research program spanning trapped-ion quantum computing, precision quantum metrology (including optical clocks), and hybrid ultracold atom–ion systems.

He is also the founder of Quantum Art, an Israeli trapped-ion quantum computing company.
