Prof. Roee Ozeri leads the trapped-ion and quantum optics group at the Weizmann Institute of Science. His group's research spans ion-based quantum computing, precision optical clocks, and cold atom–ion interactions. He was a postdoctoral researcher in David Wineland's group at NIST before establishing his lab at Weizmann.
