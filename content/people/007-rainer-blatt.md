Rainer Blatt is an experimental physicist who helped establish **trapped ions** as a leading platform for **quantum information processing**, **quantum simulation**, and **precision measurement**. He is a Professor at the University of Innsbruck and a Research Director at IQOQI Innsbruck (ÖAW), and he is a co-founder of Alpine Quantum Technologies (AQT), a trapped-ion quantum computing company spun out from Innsbruck.

Blatt earned his doctorate at the University of Mainz and later held research positions including a period at JILA (Boulder). His Innsbruck group has produced landmark results in multi-qubit entanglement, quantum teleportation, and programmable quantum simulation with trapped ions.
