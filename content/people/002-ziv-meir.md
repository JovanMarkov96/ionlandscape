Dr. Ziv Meir is an experimental physicist and principal investigator at the Weizmann Institute of Science. His research develops quantum-logic techniques—originally created for trapped-ion quantum computing and optical clocks—to control, detect, and manipulate single trapped molecular ions, enabling “molecular qubits” and new precision spectroscopy capabilities.

He earned his MSc and PhD at the Weizmann Institute under Prof. Roee Ozeri, with doctoral work on hybrid atom–ion systems and micromotion effects in atom–ion collisions. He later held postdoctoral positions at the Weizmann Institute and at the University of Basel in the group of Prof. Stefan Willitsch, expanding toward quantum-logic spectroscopy and molecular-ion control, before returning to establish his independent lab at Weizmann.
