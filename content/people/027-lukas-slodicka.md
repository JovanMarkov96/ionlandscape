Lukáš Slodička leads the Trapped Ions group in the Department of Optics at Palacký University Olomouc, Czech Republic. His research focuses on quantum optics with trapped ions, particularly atom-light interactions and efficient ion-photon interfaces. He completed his PhD at the University of Innsbruck, working on trapped ion crystals for quantum bit implementation.
