K. Rajibul Islam is an Associate Professor at the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) and the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Waterloo. His research focuses on experimental quantum many-body physics, particularly quantum simulation of frustrated spin models with trapped ions. He leads the Laboratory for Quantum Information with Trapped Ions (QITI) and co-founded Open Quantum Design, offering the world's first open-source, full-stack trapped-ion quantum computer.
