Luming Duan is a Yao Qizhi Chair Professor at Tsinghua University's Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS) and an Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. His group has achieved major breakthroughs in trapped-ion quantum simulation, including stable trapping of up to 512 ions and quantum simulations with 300 ion qubits—the largest-scale multi-ion quantum simulation with single-qubit resolution to date. He is known for the DLCZ protocol for long-distance quantum communication.
