Christopher R. Monroe is a physicist and a leading figure in trapped-ion quantum information science. He is the Gilhuly Family Presidential Distinguished Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Physics at Duke University, and a co-founder of IonQ, a company commercializing trapped-ion quantum computers.

Monroe earned his PhD at the University of Colorado Boulder under Carl Wieman, and then worked at NIST in Boulder with David J. Wineland. His research has helped establish core trapped-ion techniques for high-fidelity entangling gates, quantum simulation, and scalable modular architectures.
