Prof. Yuval Shagam is an experimental physicist and Assistant Professor at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, where he leads the **Molecular Quantum Technology Lab**. His research centers on **precision molecular ion trapping**, **quantum control of molecular systems**, cold quantum chemistry, and **precision spectroscopy** for tests of fundamental symmetry (such as parity violation) and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.

Dr. Shagam completed his BSc in Physics and Computer Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, followed by an MSc and PhD in Chemical Physics at the Weizmann Institute of Science under Prof. Edvardas Narevicius, where he studied quantum effects in cold chemistry. He then conducted postdoctoral research at **JILA (University of Colorado and NIST)** with Professors Eric A. Cornell and Jun Ye, focusing on precision measurements using trapped molecular ions, including studies relevant to the electron’s electric dipole moment.

At the Technion, his group is building ion traps and quantum tools to achieve **pristine quantum state control of complex molecular ions**, explore **cold ion–neutral collisions**, and develop quantum sensing techniques for chiral molecule detection and fundamental physics tests.
