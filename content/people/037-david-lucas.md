David M. Lucas leads the Ion Trap Quantum Computing Group at the University of Oxford alongside Andrew Steane. The Oxford group is one of the world's leading centers for trapped-ion quantum computing, working with calcium and strontium ions on quantum error correction, high-fidelity quantum gates, and optical clocks.
