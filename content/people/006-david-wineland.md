David J. Wineland is a Nobel Prize–winning experimental physicist known for pioneering techniques to **trap, laser-cool, and coherently control single ions**, enabling major advances in **precision atomic clocks** and **trapped-ion quantum information processing**. He spent decades at NIST (Boulder), where his group developed foundational methods for high-fidelity quantum logic with ions, and later joined the University of Oregon as a Research Professor.

Wineland received his PhD in Physics from Harvard University under Norman F. Ramsey, and did postdoctoral research at the University of Washington with Hans Dehmelt.
