Prof. **Daniel Rodríguez Rubiales** is a Spanish experimental physicist and *Catedrático de Universidad* at the **University of Granada**, where he leads the **Ion Traps and Lasers Laboratory** — Spain’s *only* experimental ion-trapping facility of its kind. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

His work spans **ion trap physics**, **quantum sensing**, and **precision mass spectrometry** at the intersection of quantum optics, nuclear physics, and fundamental measurement science. The laboratory uniquely operates **two trap platforms** — a high-field **7 Tesla Penning trap** and a **linear Paul trap** — and has implemented **laser cooling, Doppler cooling, and fluorescence detection of trapped ions**. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

The group has contributed to experiments including **Doppler cooling and Coulomb crystals of ⁴⁰Ca⁺ ions**, **quantum mass spectrometry with thorium isotopes** (e.g., ²³²Th⁺), and **resonant detection of trapped ions using quartz resonators**, bridging techniques from nuclear physics and quantum optics. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

Rodríguez received his **PhD in 2003** working with Penning trap systems (SHIPTRAP and ISOLTRAP) at GSI / IFIC-CSIC and has held postdoctoral positions in **France and Germany** before establishing the ion traps group in Granada. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

## Research Highlights

- **Penning trap mass spectrometry and ion spectroscopy** — development of high-precision traps for mass measurements of heavy and superheavy nuclides. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- **Laser cooling and quantum experiments with ⁴⁰Ca⁺ ions** — including first Doppler cooling observations in a 7 T trap. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- **Non-destructive ion detection techniques** using resonators and quantum-inspired methods. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
